      <p className="about--text">As a naturally curious person and a life-long user of computers it seemed only natural that I would be drawn towards software development. My journey into programming began with Java while attending Seminole State college. After graduating I wanted to make websites so I began learning the holy trinity; Javascript, HTML, and CSS. It didn't take long for me to realize this was my future career, so I went all in and haven't looked back since. <br/><br/> Nowadays I utilize Javascript, React, and the MERN stack to create responsive, interactive, and user-friendly web experiences. Outside of software development I love to rock climb and cook for people. </p>
